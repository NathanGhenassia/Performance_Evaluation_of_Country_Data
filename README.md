Data science offers a powerful toolkit for understanding global socioeconomic disparities. This study investigates the effectiveness of a combined modeling approach for identifying countries in high need of assistance, utilizing a country-level dataset sourced from Kaggle. The proposed framework leverages unsupervised clustering, supervised classification and regression analysis. By integrating insights from all models, the framework identifies countries exhibiting characteristics of low development, high aid requirements, and belonging to clusters with similar disadvantaged profiles. This data-driven approach, informed by a rich Kaggle dataset, advances the field of data science for globa development. It demonstrates the value of combining best-in-class models and genetic algorithms to leverage the quality and efficiency of this analysis process, ultimately informing policy interventions aimed at promoting global equity and sustainable development.
